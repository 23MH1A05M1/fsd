            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
            typesetting industry. <br/>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br/> when an unknown printer 
            took a galley of type and scrambled it to sake a type specisen book.
            <br>

            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s  
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with desktop publishing software Like Aldus Pageftaker 
            including versions of Lorem Ipsum
